# Terminal-Todo
Terminal Todo | Python todo list terminal app

# Run
To run it, run the `main.py` file in your terminal, and it should run, then you can start using it!

# Info
The `app.py`, was a program that I made to test some things out, so you can just ignore that file. Also you are free to add more, and make it even better.
